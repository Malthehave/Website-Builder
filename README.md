# Website Builder

A web-based open source website builder. 

You can drag and drop components to a preview that will appear to the right of your screen.

This version is still very much a work in progress. Therefore expect to see improvments and new featers being added regurally. 

## How to use

### Download

```bash
# Clone the code
git clone https://github.com/Malthehave/website-builder.git
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the develpoment server
npm run dev
```
